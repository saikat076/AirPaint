# AirPaint

This project is a hand gesture-based paint application that uses OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Python. The application allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using hand gestures, with options to select different colors or clear the canvas. The canvas and camera windows are adjusted to occupy half of the laptop screen each.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Use your hand gestures to draw on the canvas.
- **Color Selection**: Switch between different colors (red, blue, green, black, and white) using hand gestures.
- **Clear Canvas**: Clear the entire canvas with a gesture.
- **Canvas and Camera Window**: The canvas and camera feed are displayed in half of the laptop screen each.

## Installation

To run this application, you'll need to install the necessary Python libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
